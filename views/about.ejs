    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>
      This To-Do List app was created during my early exploration into web development. It’s a minimalist, functional notes app built with Node.js, Express, and EJS templating. 
      Although it doesn’t use a database yet, it helped solidify my understanding of server-side rendering, routing, and form handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next version will include persistent data storage using PostgreSQL — but this version remains a meaningful snapshot of where it all began.
