## 📌 About the Project

**To-do-List v1** is a beginner-level full-stack web application built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **EJS**. It allows users to add and track their daily tasks with a clean interface and real-time interaction. This version does **not** use a database — items are stored in memory during a single session.

This project helped me solidify key concepts like server-side rendering, routing, modular view structure, and basic form handling.

## 🛠️ Features

- Add and track to-do items using a dynamic input form
- Separate **Work List** view with custom route and item storage
- Responsive design using **Flexbox** and **media queries**
- Modular EJS templates (`header`, `footer`, `list`) for clean layout
- Styled with custom CSS and supports both desktop and mobile screens
- Hosted live on **Render**

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Node.js** — JavaScript runtime
- **Express** — Web framework
- **EJS** — Embedded JavaScript templates for server-side rendering
- **Body-Parser** — Middleware for form submissions
- **HTML / CSS** — Responsive design with a modern layout
- **Render** — Cloud hosting platform

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Structuring a Node.js + Express app using views, routes, and middleware
- Building reusable layouts with partial EJS templates
- Handling user input with forms and dynamically updating the UI
- Implementing basic responsiveness for mobile-first design
- Hosting apps on cloud platforms like Render
